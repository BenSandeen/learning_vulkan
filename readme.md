I have two main goals for this project:
1. I want to use it to learn Rust better and to refresh my graphics programming, using the newish Vulkan API
2. I want to simulate some cool physics and stuff visually

Since I am primarily doing this as a learning project, I am not planning on taking advantage of many of the cool and
extremely useful libraries provided by the community, for example, for performing 3D physics calculations and whatnot.
